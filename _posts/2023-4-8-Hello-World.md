title: Hello world, it's treesha here!
---

I'm thrisha and people pronounce my name in different ways, right now 'treesha' is my favourite.

Starting this clutter free minimalistic blog using [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Took me just minutes to get this running!
#### Why ?
 Three  months into 2023, and I've received few compliments regarding my writing, work related written communication as well as for this [random kirukal (scribble)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbX46IjPS2y/?img_index=1). Firstly, this has given me the motivation to write something and I believe recording events and feelings will give me a good time travel effect later in my life. I'm extremely grateful to have received such compliments, this seems to keep me occupied. 
 _time travel effect :_ I've changed tremendously over the years, and I believe I'll continue to do so. Writing can capture some parts of me and store it. I can always come back to see how I was.
 Secondly, at the moment I've lot of inconsistent and conradictory events happening in my life, extreme awesome and horrible stuff at the same time. Writing can help bring clarity, which I seek for. I'm not sure of my consistency here, but writing can force me to think, which will inturn force me to read other's work - develop comprehension, vocabulary.

#### What I plan to write ? 
No clue. Beep boop. Anything and everything. Things I learn, things I feel, artistic stuff, places I travel to. I'm losing trust in instagram posts, I want to add lot more _"meta data"_ to my images, and this could be a perfect place for that! 

> தாய் மொழியில் படித்தால் ஆழமாக தகவல்கள் புரிய வாய்ப்பு உள்ளது என ஒரு நம்பிக்கை. அதனால் ஆகையால் நான் படித்ததை தமிழ் நோட்ஸ் எடுக்கலாம் என்றுள்ளேன். எப்படி செல்கிறது என்று பார்ப்போம்.

> I've a belief that there is a possibility of understanding information deeply by studying in mother tounge. That's why I intend to take Tamil notes. Let's see how it goes


#### Whats up for me ?
A religious trip to shiradi is on the way! and few more exciting trips on the way too. I wish to buy an iphone to take lots of pictures and save them here!
Wish to study and gain more depth of domain knowledge, talk to lot of people, gain more perspective. Sort out some things, be my ideal self.
Everybody has weaknesses, it is our responsibility to play our strengths 💪 _"Figure out my strengths"_ is also under my agenda

Hope to keep posting! Byeeee Have a nice day!
