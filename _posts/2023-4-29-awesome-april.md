title: Thrisha's Awesome April 2023
---

Greetings, my dear fellow homo sapiens, I hope you're doing well from the bottom of my heart, if not please hold on a lot tighter, the ride will get more fun and beautiful as we go!

Dumping a lot of stuff into a single post, just like overfilling the luggage : ) Bear with me, I have a lot to say.

### <a id="#How-are-you,-Thrisha-?">How are you, Thrisha ?</a>
Nalam, nallamariya aaval :)

You did not ask me, but anyway Thrisha is doing fantabulous and barely surviving at the same time.
My life feels like a bull run, to the moon 🚀 and if you come a little closer and zoom inside my life - beep boop - its bad. I am being tossed around the bestest feelings and low ones. Nevertheless I'm in so much love with my life at the moment.

#### <a id="#Compliments">Compliments of April 2023</a>
Compliments, I am now wearing these like badge of honor. 

This 'blog / *naat kuripu* / *open diary*' is a result of a couple of sweet compliments. Recording here some of the compliments I received this month 💛

- I can become a "novel writer", yes it sounded amazing until I digged a little bit and they said - I use a lot of "emotional punch lines, very dramatic and touchy", so I could become a mega serial writer.
    - Unsure about this, am I that dramatic ? What do you think ?
    - I feel more emotional than ever before 💛 and more like a Boom boom boomer.
- Amplified compliments by my friends
    - Creative photographer
    - I was told I'm charismatic 😲
- *"You are a talented genius girl with a minute percentage of irregular but periodic toxicity in ur brain"*
    - This is my favorite as it is from my favorite person (*kan avar*)
    - *avar* will be slightly annoyed by this being posted here, it is true and I'm on the path towards improvement

Disclaimer : I ain't a movie buff, a very normal person watching and letting you know my views.

- [Vaazhl](https://g.co/kgs/8ECxPj)

Watched this for gorgeous goddess like actress [TJ Bhanu](https://www.instagram.com/tjbhanu/channel/). Lot of loop holes, a weird story line according to my taste. However the picturesque scenes, the mood of the movie made it a good watch, I felt happy watching it.

One of my beliefs presented in the movie - [*People around us have the potential to change our lives*](https://youtube.com/shorts/_lhTMYw2CHk?feature=share)

- [Pathu Thala](https://g.co/kgs/t1uPUE)

Watched it as a prime movie date with *avar*. Was very engaging, slow here and there, lot of good dialogs, beautiful music loved watching this!
[Thrisha's creations](#Thrishas-creations)
Few lines I liked - Not completing them, so as to not spoil it for you

*"Maan pona dharithiram ... "*

[*Ninaiviruka ?*](https://youtu.be/NXV92xljgPk?t=33) song. Melting sir, melting. Songs with a question hits me.

[*Andha aagayam podhadha paravai ondru*](https://youtube.com/shorts/l7kLLvJ059s?feature=share), another beauty

A lovely Thamizh poem shared in the movie
> நல்லார் ஒருவர் உளரேல் அவர்பொருட்(டு)
எல்லார்க்கும் பெய்யும் மழை.
Nallar oruver ulavel aarporutu ellarkum peiyum mazhai

I guess it means, the rains pour down because of the one good person who exists here. A single person is responsible for the entire downpour (And here the downpour is a good omen)

### <a id="#Thrishas-creations">Thrisha's creations</a>

Thrisha likes to do multiple things, not particularly good at anything. Recently, I've calmed down a lot, I feel the peace, the *nimmadhi*. There are sleepless nights where I doubt and question every atom in the world.. And I take the time to indulge myself in the creative stuff, showcasing them here :) 

#### <a id="#Tulip-origami">Tulip origami</a>
![Tulip origami image](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7d/b0/88/7db088a0a959e7bbf3d18cf0356a0ef6.jpg)

Made this simple origami tulip flower arranged in a tulip basket. This is kept in my colleagues desk, one of the flower represents her and other two her sisters. Three beautiful tulips representing the beautiful sisters. I will always be in awe of the way she cares for her younger sisters, I'd say to her that I wish I had an elder sister like her and the response I always get is - *Be that elder sister*
I'd just laugh it off, it won't be happening. I'll always be admiring her resilience. 

#### <a id="#cute-meme">A cute meme</a>

I had my first flight recently on April 13th, 2023, the day right next to my birthday. And I couldn't stop thinking of this during the flight. More on the flight experience [here](#My-first-flight)

### <a id="#Shiradi">Shiradi</a>

Relate to [this post a lot](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cqu65dup4TG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). I'm no theist nor atheist, I might belong to the Agnostic category, *Ram-ay aandalum, Raavanan aandalum ennaku oru kavalai illai*.

I understand that, to swim through life we must have faith in something. To grip and hold on to something. Right now, for me the grip is in the grand scheme of things and some little faith in myself.

I really like the concept of 'principles and ways of living' than faith into God. But when there is an emergency I naturally pray to God, as I grew up doing so. 

> Naan enga kadavul illanu sonnen? Iruntha nalla irukum thaana solren

It really is a miracle that I went to visit Shiradi. I'm born into a religious family, but it is always Lord Sri Srinivasa Sri Venkateshwara in the center. This trip came into place because of a TV serial. 

My grandparents were watching the Sai Baba serial and my grandfather prayed to Sai Baba, and he was graced by him - or he believes so - or he really is. So he wanted to visit Shiradi to show his gratefulness and I was one of his escort. That is how I ended up in Shiradi, surrounded by Sai followers. I really loved being there and wish to visit again to get a more slower calm dharshan!

#### <a id="#My-first-flight">My first flight</a>

Extremely jealous of the pilots who get to see this beautiful, paradise view everyday as a part of their jobs. I'm aware of their critical jobs, but witnessing this much beauty everyday makes me jealous.

The clouds surrounding you just feels like you are in a nice bed resting in heaven.
The take off feels like a uphill ride on a rollercoaster, very thrilling. During the landing when the flight tires screech the road, suddenly it feels like you are in a express train - its noisy and starts to shake!

Hugged by clouds, I mostly did not feel the flight moving. Express trains seem to give us a much faster view (the surrounding passes by very very very fast.)
The speed of flight according to Google is 700-900 km/hr, and for a train it is 160 km/hr, but believe me sitting in a flight just felt like being caressed by the clouds!
I sure did not feel like I was being carried away 700 km/hr, it felt slow, it felt like a nice soft afternoon dream. 

And I was blessed to get into the flight on an afternoon, beautiful gorgeous dreamy clouds, and during return I was in a night flight, able to see the stars that shine on the surface Earth.

Shiradi was a simple town, the airport was surrounded by barren land. I'm blessed to have an awesome father who likes to drive and take us trips, so I've traveled by car a LOT. So a different thing that stood out for me was the transition of the language and culture.
Example, when you drive from TamilNadu to Kerala, you'll see the sign boards slowly start incorporating Malayalam into them and in sometime Tamil totally disappears and you are completely into Kerala territory. The culture, however small can still be little noticeable - different food boards, people talking different to you.

Chennai to Shiradi is 1.3K km, and within an hour I was transported to a totally different place! It felt weird and amazing.


#### <a id="#agend">Shiradi Agenda</a>

Shiradi, the temple was shining so bright Gorgeous Gold!
Stayed in a hotel few mins away from the temple, the temple was very crowded. Hmm Personally, I wished it was a more relaxing experience. 
Here is a nice Sai Baba temple in Chennai, I'd like if you visit this place - It will always be a calm place which I'm fond of
After SaiBaba dharshan, we were given some [Vibuthi](http://www.saibabaofindia.com/significanceofvibhuti.htm#:~:text=Baba%20says%20Vibhuti%20is%20also,the%20confusion%20already%20existing%20there.), and boodhi as prasadham.

We also saw other places inside the temple, which I'm technically less aware of - Take diversion to other useful resources, if you want to know more about Shiradi.

Food - Maharashtra Sambar was not appealing for me. The Chole Bhatura was fantastic, All food were very generous (large quantity) than what we get in Tamil Nadu.

Next day, we visited few other places nearby and went shopping.
I bought a white salwar made of Sugarcane fabric - it looks shiny yet soft and comfortable. And I bought some bangles, more prasadham, few Sai Baba fridge magnets, chandan (Sandhanam - smelt very good, but I barely use it) and white embroidered sandals. 
Then we had to pack our bags and leave for the flight.

Very short memorable trip.

### <a id="#Owning-an-iPhone">Owning an iPhone</a>

> “For money you can have everything it is said. No, that is not true. You can buy food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; soft beds, but not sleep; knowledge but not intelligence; glitter, but not comfort; fun, but not pleasure; acquaintances, but not friendship; servants, but not faithfulness; grey hair, but not honor; quiet days, but not peace. The shell of all things you can get for money. But not the kernel. That cannot be had for money.”
― Arne Garborg

Oops. This is how I feel sometimes owning an iPhone. Having the best camera doesn't make you a good photographer. I need a lot of work.

I love taking pictures with my iPhone :) I did not flex with it, however few sharp-eyed *clever* people spotted it was an iPhone and congratulated me for it 💛.

I tried to make a video out of my first flight experience, I'd give it a 4/10, I'm not very happy of the entire outcome - Lot of shakes, very low dull colors here and there, rushing soon. I feel like I always keep rushing - rushing to get things done. And once the things are done, I sit and worry that they are done too soon, and not so great. In my next attempts, I'd try to improve (AFAIK Openly admitting and nit picking our faults is the only way to improve faster, so your brutally honest feedbacks will also be appreciated).

And here is the video, please view it HeHeHe😸, it's okayish, still have a look and share my feels.

### <a id="#To-the-mountains">To the mountains</a>

I am blessed with a trip to Leh, Ladakh (I'll be there mid May!). I'm very intimidated, daunted and extremely excited. It will be my first snow! I haven't experienced snow in VGP Snow world, the only ice I have interacted with is ice cream and freezer ice :) So I cannot tell you how much rollercoaster I feel inside my stomach.
I'll take lots of better pictures and videos - record it. I hope to take you with me to the same mountains by my magical words and visuals!

### <a id="#More-Birthday-Cake">More Birthday Cake</a>

It was end of the month, last friday, and I was the only person in the office who was born in April.. So I had the honor of cutting the cake (in front of the entire office)

Oh my God, I don't really celebrate birthdays, but seeing the smiley faces singing "Happy birthday" was so pleasing. Do the stage performers get to see happy faces like this once in a while ? I'm jealous of them too now.

Nearly fifty pairs of eyes and 50*15 teeth haha, and few known faces here and there, I think, teachers and professors face a lot of people like this everyday, Bus conductors too, with little lesser amounts of happiness. Eventhough most people were excited for eating the cake rather than wishing me, the aura and being the center of attention was overwhelming and pleasing!

I'll try to sing happy birthday louder & happier - next time when I'm singing for someone 🤩

### <a id="#feels">Feels of writing this</a>

I like recording the details, however this is what I've been feeling like while writing this:
