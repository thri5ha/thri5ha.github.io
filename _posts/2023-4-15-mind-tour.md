### <a id="#Catching-up-and-addressing-some-comments">Catching up and addressing some comments</a>
Out of the handful of people who read the first post, some were kind enough to let me know it's nice and cute! Nandrigal (Thank you very much!).

Regarding a question about my mother tongue, technically, it's telugu. Born and brought up in Chennai, I grew up studying Samacheer kalvi Tamil books. I know to read, write Tamil and 0 % of telugu, I'm not into Tollywood, and even if I do watch Tollywood movies, I'd watch the Tamil dub than the original.

_Telugu by birth and Tamil by heart._ I guess the Samacheer kalvi books and tamil movies really influenced me. Numerous tamil poems which I had to memorize, and dramatic metaphors! One such poem which was extremely dramatic (funny to me), I really loved it that I created an animation video for this poem in 2020 and posted it on youtube with my voiceover, cringed at it so bad that I deleted the video, the channel and everything later on. I'll continue more on this [here](#Cringe-vs-wholesome)

 I enjoyed a holiday for an entire week because of Semozhi maanadu and can you forget the [beautiful semozhiyana thamizh mozhiya song](https://youtu.be/lRITPjraXgA) where lot of artists collaborated? 
 
 I'm getting into a lot of irrelevant details here, but to answer the question _"you are telugu, right ?"_ I showcased a person as an example, who is [Paridhimaar kalaingar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Parithimar_Kalaignar).
 
 > இவரின் இயற்பெயரான “சூரியநாராயணர்” என்ற வடமொழிப் பெயரை தமிழில் “பரிதிமாற் கலைஞர்” என்று பெயர் மாற்றம் செய்துக் கொண்டார்

> Paridhimaar Kalaingar for his love of tamil, translated his Sanskrit name 'SuriyaNarayanar' into tamil and renamed himself as 'Paridhimaar Kalaingar'

You can have lot of mothers, lets take Lord Krishna as an example. Devaki, mother of Krishna and Yashoda is his foster mother who raised him. This can be too dramatic, Telugu is my mother tounge, but I grew up with Tamil. I really should have the right to call both languages as my mother tongue!

Writing this, a thought clouds my head.
Banglore has been renamed to Bengaluru, *writing 'தமிழ்' as Tamil is a sin, we MUST officially use* **thamizh**. 

I wrote too much here, but I really appreciate any kind of feedbacks I can get and thank you for giving the same!

### <a id="My-birthday-on-2023">My birthday on 2023</a>

I'm not a birthday person at all, not used to cutting cakes after I grew up. Not fond of birthdays too, all unlucky things happens to me on that day. Sometimes I really hate it. 

Usually we go to some temple and a dinner with family, mostly simple - nothing fancy. This is how it usually goes except for this year 2023.

Recently I'm making a *lot* of decisions by **YOLO**, not the [popular object detection neural network](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), <a id="yolo">YOLO</a> - You Only Live Once, Live like there's no tomorrow. *Disclaimer*, I'd still need permission from my parents (under the roof, under the rules.)

But little things, I do it by myself. Like what I did this year for my birthday inspired by Germans. In Germany, [people get their own cake for their birthday](https://www.mylifeingermany.com/having-birthday-in-germany/). Why do I know this ? I wanted to do masters in Germany, it did not happen and most likely will not happen, but I've some knowledge about the life there. 

I wanted to do something myself, me being little shy and also with an opinion that *cakes are overrated*, I took a different route.
I bought 1.4 Litres of vanilla family pack ice cream on the way to office, purchased cups, spoons, white chocolate chips, hershey's syrup and put the ice cream in the office refrigerator. After lunch, we had an ice cream sharing session and few of them said to me that they loved it! And they loved ice cream more than the cake! Yay. I was very excited and happy.

My younger self would have been freaked out by this, totally embarrassed. So hosting this mini ice cream sharing session was close to my heart, it has shown me that I have grown up, IDGAF about what others would think and I can make myself happy with all little tiny things, [do interesting stuff](https://youtube.com/shorts/mCOW-d79Sfg?feature=share) :)


### <a id="Working-at-odd-times">Working at odd times</a>

Apologies if you are my colleague -_- I sometimes reply to work messages during my time off or even work. **Nope**, it is not an act of buttering my bosses, I know there is nothing to gain going that way, I do this irrespective of the pay I receive. Apologies to my colleagues if this made them uncomfortable. Here are few reasons I do this:

1. Again, [YOLO](#yolo) 

    When talking about *One life*, we usually refer it for our strange, controversial, bold choices. But [YOLO](#yolo) always crosses my head whenever there is a tight work I need to do. I kind of like my job, writing some code and doing some stuff, I love debugging and making things work. I can **afford to put more time** now, as I don't have much responsibilities to full fill. Few years later I'd be consumed and possessed by my responsibilities. So I really don't mind answering some questions or doing some work. 


2. I truly want to help
3. Nothing really immerses me

    Everything is boring and [nothing really matters](https://youtu.be/fJ9rUzIMcZQ?t=312). Growing up sucks. On the scale, watching a movie and doing my work has the same value some times, so I don't mind working on my time off!
4. **Most important**, Wu Wei

    [Wu Wei](https://youtu.be/g0rhN8U14dk), 'effortless action'. It sometimes feels involuntary, just like how you breath. There is no conscious effort involved when breathing, but it is a job we do without rest. Yet it does not tires us. Something flipped, and most of the work activities have become effortless. Though sometimes I really hate sitting in front of the laptop, I want to close everything and run away, I'd still miss it. Wu Wei is a philosophy, not sure if I understand it deeply. Still, I feel drawn and connected to this.
    This can be totally funny to you, but just like *Gowtham* from *Jillunu Oru Kaadhal*, 
    
    > [idhu verum work illa, adhayum thaandi en uyiroda kalandhuta oru unarvu.](https://youtube.com/shorts/MXrzrupnQXs?feature=share)
    <br>
    Work is not just work anymore, it has mixed into my life.

Apart from this Jilunu oru Kaadhal is awesome! very lovely. All music is wonderful, lovely movie!
[Kundhavai](https://youtu.be/iuptExNo_AA) is aweseome in this movie too.


### <a id="Battle-between-the-mobiles">Battle between the mobiles</a>

In my first post I mentioned about buying an iPhone :) 

Welcome to my overthinking brain, I thought and thought and thought and thought and finally, just trusted my intuition and went for it.
I needed the best camera! I don't want the bulky original cameras, and iPhone has the popularity for having the best camera phones. However I did not want to go the Apple route.. as they are way too expensive 

Options I had:
- iPhone 13

    128 GB storage
- <s>iPhone 14</s>

    Doesn't have any significant difference to me.
    20k+ the iphone 13, but the 13 is a year older.

    The pro models, dynamic island, NOPE.
- Oneplus 11

    Has very positive reviews and I get 256 GB storage and the comparison of the cameras were nearly good  and close!

- Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra

    This one is more than double the price of iphone13 and OP11, but in the style of a Samsung Note, it had a Stylus inside me, freaked me out in the positive way, I was extremely tempted by this. 
    I have used Samsung Galaxy S3 and I was in love with it. I still love it so much.

    Unfortunately S23 Ultra was expensive, and I previously bought an iPad with the hopes of being a digital artist, but I seldom use it. So my rational brain convinced my stupid heart that this is not for me and I was freed from my temptation. 

Now the choice was mostly between OP11 and iPhone 13. However, iPhone 15 will be launched around this year and this made me wonder if I had to wait for it.

From the leaks, I understood that iPhone 15 will no longer require the fancy expensive Lightning cable and will support USB C. This is tempting, and my rational brain cannot talk me out of this because this is a great thing to wait for. Ditch the lightning. But I immediately needed a good camera phone, and was not ready to wait. So my rational brain started cooking more thoughts to turn me into buying 13. May be iPhone 15 would be expensive ? or may be due to launch of 15, they might stop 13 soon.

Here comes the twist, I was talking to a friend where he mentioned buying an action camera for 1.5K (3years ago, with an introductory offer). But still it is totally on the other spectrum of the numbers I have to pay. And I started digging into *Action cameras*, they are portable and take decent pictures as well as videos.
I wasn't interested on GoPro but similar Action cameras were starting at 5K. My brain asking me *Idhelam thevaya Thrisha, camera kaaga ivalo selavu ah*. Anyway, the shots in Action camera couldn't match the iPhone.

And again, [YOLO](#yolo) theory. I'm privileged to not pay any bills now, and definitely will be consumed and constrained by money matters later in life. My intuition just told me to go for it, and thanks to BF and my dear friend for making me push, I went for it.

I'm now owner of iPhone 13. And I bought it just on my birthday, I knew what I was doing, there was *one piece* of *baby pink colored iphone* and I grabbed it! It will be my secondary phone. I will carry around my android low budget phone with me always, it does what I need to do. To justify the expense, I need to hold on to the iPhone13 for atleast 7 years! HaHa let us see how it goes.


Bless my baby:

The superstitious lady inside me wondered *Kannu paturume..* and quickly started sketching a back cover to hide the apple logo.
And it turned out amazing! See for yourself, What do you say ?

### <a id="Cringe-vs-wholesome">Cringe vs wholesome</a>

There is just a tiny difference between wholesome and cringe. What appears cringe to you, will be wholesome to others and vice versa.

Things being cringe and wholesome can depend on the time/ age.
![cringe vs wholesome](/images/cringe_vs_wholesome.jpg)

[I love artistic stuff](/about.md), and in 2020 I did some minimal animation using powerpoint (Yes, powerpoint, from scratch drew lotus, a lady) did a voice over and posted it in youtube. I couldn't stand the cringe and ended up deleting everything. It is on top of my regret list, even if it is cringe I shouldn't have deleted it, now I lost it totally.

*Regarding the Graph,* which I drew with Powerpoint,
as we grow up, we'll give us more love and start embracing us more. Cringe level decreases with time and the wholesomeness increases with time. 

Give yourself enough time to love yourself.

##### Song of the week : 
- [People](https://youtu.be/oo7zCKkG7eU)
- [People X Nainowale Ne](https://youtu.be/wM8ziCYRlt4)

I'm totally not the person who creates playlists and listens to different songs. I grow liking for a song, put it on repeat and loop over it for days. And this is the song which possessed me recently! And yes, I came here from some kind of reels. 


Spelling mistake, grammatical and factual errors, any feedback +/- when reported will be appreciated!

Wrapping up! See you soon! Kadha ketadhu podhum, Vaanga poi velaiya paapom.
